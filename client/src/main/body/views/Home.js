                 <h3>Nothing in life comes easy. Not even Poi! There are many different
                 levels of spinners
                 and everyone has there own style. There isnt such a thing as right
                 or wrong in poi. There are proper ways of doing things but there isnt anything that states the
                 right or wrong way to do.. well anything.
